# Methods

This chapter documents ideas to analyze the raw signals. 

## Training a conv-net
1. The raw signal is simulated with the generative model in @eq-observation
2. A conv-net is trained to reconstruct sensor activity $a_{i}(t)$ for $i \in$ sensors, and terms describing hemodynamics $h_{\textrm{oxy}}(t), h_{\textrm{deoxy}}(t)$ by minimizing mean-squared error at each time.
3. We consider the input organized into $j \times \lambda$ channels for the each fixed-interval of time $t$

## Next steps
 - Include autocorrelation data
 - Train with larger batchsizes/ regularize the model
 - Updates to the loss function/ generative model to incorporate Poisson noise
 - Correlation across laser/wavelengths for generative model suggests high redundancy

## Ideas to generalizing model to real data
 - Adversarial training to learn parameters of the generative model 
 - Autoencoding objective (perhaps some specific channels) for regularization while training and transfer learning (fine tuning for real data)
