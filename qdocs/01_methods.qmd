# Methods

This chapter documents ideas to analyze the raw signals. 

## Training a conv-net

1. The raw signal is simulated with the generative model in @eq-observation
2. A conv-net is trained to reconstruct sensor activity $a(i,t), h_{\textrm{oxy}}(t), h_{\textrm{deoxy}}(t), m(t)$
3. Assume $n(t,j)$ is given

## Strategies to model real data

 - Adversarial approach could samples of $a(i,t), h_{\textrm{oxy}}(t), h_{\textrm{deoxy}}(t), m(t)$, which can then be combined as per phenomenological model
 - Autoencoding objective (perhaps restricted to specific channels) could be used to fine-tune model on real data.
